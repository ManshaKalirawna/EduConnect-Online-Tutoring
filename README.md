About This Project

EduConnect is an online tutoring platform that connects students with tutors for both in-person and virtual classes. I designed and implemented the database schema, developed the main backend functionality, and built the front-end interface to ensure a smooth user experience.

Contributors

While I led the project and handled the core features, I collaborated with Yugam Arora
